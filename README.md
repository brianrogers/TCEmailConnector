TCEmailConnector
================

TCEmail Connector is a TinCan Email Connector for Google AppEngine. It allows you to email a special format to your GAE server setup and convert that input to a TinCanAPI/ExperienceAPI statement.

This is just an example and would need to be edited to server a more specific purpose.

##Installation
Add the files to your GAE python application and use the supplied GAE email address for your account.
